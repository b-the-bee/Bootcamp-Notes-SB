At College, I decided to do an Extended Project Qualification (EPQ). As I could’ve chosen any topic, this provided a unique opportunity to pick a subject of interest and academic challenge. Taking this into consideration, for my EPQ, I chose “The Origins of Consciousness and If AI Can Ever Become Conscious”.

As the EPQ is a long project that required a significant amount of time on top of my studies, it was vital to stay motivated, show resilience and persevere. 

I challenged myself to tackle a subject that was quite complex to give me the 

opportunity to test my research and analytical skills. To keep up with my work, I made a rigorous plan to meet deadlines set out by my tutor, assessing what should take priority. I spent time inside and outside of class researching all the possible branches for topics within my project. I found motivation in the fact-finding process as there were many interesting topics. To show resilience, I regularly sought feedback from my EPQ tutor to improve my work. 

I persevered through this project, creating a document and presentation to illustrate my findings, thoughts and ideas. As a result, I received a grade of B.

## Fixed vs Growth Mindset:

![[Pasted image 20240508153126.png]]
Set-backs and failures are viewed as challenges to be overcome, not problems to stop you.

Important in changing fixed mindsets:
- Know their needs, how important it is
- Magnitude of change

Fixed mindset:
You believe that your ability and intelligence can't be changed.
You either have the skills or you don't, it means you are easily discouraged etc

Alex just got a new job as a Junior Data Engineer with a well-known

fintech in his town. He comes from his **first day** of work and says to his wife, _“This job is too hard._ **_It felt like I did not even matter._** _I was asked to just look at data and clean Excel files while others were coding and writing processes from scratch. I would not know where to start to code and write new processes. I feel like I will just be cleaning data and passing them to others_ _**forever**__.I don’t think that I am the right person to do this kind of work__. It is so challenging.”_
