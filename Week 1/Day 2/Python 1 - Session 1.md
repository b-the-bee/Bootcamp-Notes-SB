Yay another hello world, although a lot of issue fixing which is kinda cool ig.

Expressions from the file are evaluated but not printed in console.

A set is a list of numbers without repetition:

```python
numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

print(numbers)
```


Some python from the lesson below:

```python
x = 2

y = 8

  

tuple_var = (x, y)

print(tuple_var)

  

colours = ["Yes", "Yellow", "Bob", "Red", "Radish"]

print(colours)

  

numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

print(numbers)

  

data = {

    "cool": "Beans",

    "red": "radish",

    "yellow": "bananas",

    "tuple": tuple_var,

    "colours": colours,

    "numbers": numbers

}

  

print(data)
```
