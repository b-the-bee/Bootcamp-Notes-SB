## Objectives:
- Explain what Data Engineering is and how the industry works with data.
- Describe the role and responsibilities of a Data Engineer
- Identify the challenges faced by a data Engineer and strategires necessary to overcome them.


## Data Engineering

- Is the aspect of data science that focuses on practical applications of data collection and analysis.
- For all the work that data scientists do to answer questions using large sets of information, there have to be mechanisms for collecting and validating that information.

ETL: Extract Transform Load
API: Application Program Interface - Web interface
RPC: Remote Procedure Call - Similar to API
SOAP/REST: Remote services

### How data engineering came about:
Seems modern, but used to be called information engineering, big data problems so in the last 20 years or so, huge quantities of data flying around. Must have more specialised persons for it.


### Responsibilities:
- Develop storage and processing systems
- Deal with imperfect data
- Improve source data quality
- Balance business and user requirements
- Data modelling, mining and production

## Day in the life

- Standup - morning meeting to see what did yesterday, stuck on, what going to do today
- Finding next set of work for short period of time, largely be out there writing code and infrastructure definitions, testing & documenting
- We need to be able to communicate technical concepts to non-technical people and have them understand.
- Quite dynamic, find more doing communication stuff and then those who dont want to communicate, value in both areas.



#### Think about the activities that a data engineer does in a day - What do you think might be some qualities of a Data Engineer?

- Being able to solve things on-the-go
- Communication and Teamwork, agile teams
- Documentation
- Detail Oriented - Picking up early
- Good at interpreting other code(?) - Code review

Reducing assumptions
Team VS problem
Take responsibility
Communication++

See how going about it, organisation
Are other juniors doing better/same kind of work - not always as simple as "im not good enough"
Coordinate work to get it done the best way
"Do you have any proof of this" Why do you think this - projection
