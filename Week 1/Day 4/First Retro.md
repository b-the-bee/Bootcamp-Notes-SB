- Ideas

A lot was put up on the whitebaord, some concepts notes I highlighted were:
- Great personalities all around
- Putting together a functioning piece of code for the task

- The pseudocode was confusing
- Going back to the main menu in the code
- Didn't cover append, enumerate or del which was required for the mini project task
- Trying to troubleshoot others' problems, couldn't always help one another

- Do our own pseudocode
- Spread out people who have coding experience
- Expand on using python with examples
- Didn't use append enumerate, delete/pop - Could've done it using a dictionary
then vote on them and take actions:
