## The acronyms of Clean Code:

- KISS - Keep it simple, stupid
- DRY - Don't repeat yourself (put it in a function)
	- WET (half joke) - Write everything twice (doesn't mean we want to get ahead of ourselves and put everything functions)
- YAGNI - You aren't gonna need it (Don't get ahead of yourself with functionality, functionality for what we need right now)
- RTFM - Read the fucking manual, documentation can helps a lot but ain't always the greatest
