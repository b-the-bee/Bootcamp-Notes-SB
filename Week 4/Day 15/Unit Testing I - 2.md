## TDD

Test driven development is a pretty awkward way, and should not be treated as a default. Doing TDD can easily paint yourself into a corner.
Doing it in such a hyper-specific way that TDD creates, can't really do much else with the function, without having to rewrite a dozen different tests.
Would recommend writing a function, messing around, do what you need to do then start testing, bringing out other things you care about, missed features bugs etc to improve rather than building it from the ground up over and over.
