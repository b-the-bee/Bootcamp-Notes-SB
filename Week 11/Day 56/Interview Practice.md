2nd part
Interest piqued in high school introduced to python and webdev

Analysing results of experiments and labs, really enjoyed analysing, interpreting and producing insights into experiments.

After I left uni, I started to seek even more skills, independently study Python, SQL and R for data science. 

5th part 
Always thought how I would merge these skills from my past
The part i've enjoyed the most is building an ETL pipeline, doing projects

Wrap up with question as final statement


## STAR Question - Mistake made at work

 Situation/Scene - Mention part of a team, elaborate on situation. Telling story to someone who knows nothing what we're talking about, make sure the answer is universal, treat it as such, any interview the same way. Don't take it for advantage that an interviewer knows what it means.
	
Whilst on the generation programme, team and i on project, the mistake that was made was... Notified the rest of the team.

Give them alternatives, for instance, if i'd already submitted the work to submit, notify, roll out, ote of mistake, covered all bases.

Result that rest of the team to free to proceed, code submitted, completed presentation, team happy i was happy, let my team know exactly what had happened same situation again.

Analyse the successful result, resourceful, growth mindset.

Taken me making a mistake to a training aspect to the rest of the team, win-win situation feedback outcomes etc.
