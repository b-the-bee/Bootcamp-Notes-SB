In order to make dreams come true, use SMART to set goals wiser, instead of far away achievable

### Specific

Know exactly what you want, vague goals are harder to achieve.

### Measurable

Break larger goals into smaller goals, building up to the larger goal.

### Attainable

Need to feel and see progress and know that have completed things along the way, can be completed in a set time frame.

### Relevant

Why do what you do, do they help you move towards your goal? So, so so. WHY you want what you want.

### Time bound

When do you want to complete this goal by? Deadline to see what actions can be taken when to achieve the goal.
