## Why do we test?
- Speed
- Correctness
- User experience - usability
- Weaknesses

If I write code now, I've got to be able to tell why I tested what I did.


## Different types of software testing:
- **Unit Testing**: validating a unit of code in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: validating different units, modules or components of a software application as a combined entity
- **System Testing**: validating the various components of an application interact together in the full, integrated system or application.
- **Sanity Testing**: ensure the changes introduced into the system are working as expected.
- **Smoke Testing**: verifying that the most important functionalities of system are working.
- **Interface Testing**: validating the interaction between the two systems or applications that are involved in the software application.
- **Regression Testing**: ensuring an application still functions as expected after any code changes, updates, or improvements.
- **Performance Testing**
- **Security/Penetration Testing**

### A different approach

#### Unit:
- Metal
- Screws
- Handle
All the pieces

#### Integration:
Do the pieces fit together and stay together, does it work with other systems (heat under the kettle)

#### End to end:
Testing if the whole thing works, can I make a cuppa tea
