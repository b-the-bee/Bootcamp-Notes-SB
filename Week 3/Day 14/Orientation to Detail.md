We started by doing a spot the difference exercise.

Key thing is to focus on the detail, employing different strategies for these.

## Why is it important?
Data engineers need to be able to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, ensuring high quality data is checked for so that the data can be passed on to the other data teams. Being able to clean up data to get rid of less important for more important data, it is important to be oriented to detail so important data isn't accidentally included and less important data is removed.
