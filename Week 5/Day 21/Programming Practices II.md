## Documentation
- Include what adds value for understanding
- Code comments are good but also lean towards self-documenting code
- Include a README. Tell people how to install, set up use and contributed code to your application.

## Refactoring
WE improve the way our code is written without affecting the end result.
Refactoring is a gradual practice, do it as a regular practice.

### Technical Debt (Tech Debt)

Deadlines and priorities will sometimes force us to take shortcuts and implement quick and dirty solutions for our problems.
Tech debt reflects the implied cost of additional rework by choosing an easy and limited solution now instead of using a batter approach that would take longer.
Every time we take on of shortcuts, tech debt gets bigger.
