# Agile Principles

##### Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through the early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
#### Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

##### Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

#### Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

##### Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

#### The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

##### Working software is the primary measure of progress.

#### Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

##### Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

#### Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.

##### The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

#### At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.
