#employability #data-engineering 
Classmate:

Why do you want to be a data engineer?
- Through all his life had a huge interest in computers and tech
- Older brother would get tech things that are more adanced, always interested in figuring how to use them, gaming using a pc.
- Went in a gneeral focus of education, computer related thigns, computer science in college andd maths, strongest point was statistics, went in to university into computer science
- one of the modules was machine learning which was quite data focused, would rteain ML algo on dataset for different purposes
- General interest in tech and computers, more interest in data
- When looking to specialise, looking at gen course, saw datteng saw modules that hed enjoy doing and building skills through that


**Refer back to initial question** <---------


Me:
How do your past experiences line up with this role?

Feedback:
- Relevant experience in other codes - looking around in coding space
- Mentioning transferrable skills from working in bar is really good
- Fantastic answer - really liked the bar work to being a data engineer and gave outcome, generating more business
- Thought it was really good - relevant skills and technologies, personal interest in own time
- Understood the wider complex of data engineer
- Liked how started coding out of interest, getting on generation course to improve those skills
- Shows interest in subject matter, pre any course, shown interest in the area
- Definitely really good answer, passionate about coding - criticism, seemed a bit like reading - more practice would smooth over
- Liked how I went into detail with experiences
- Start felt a little bit of going off into the woods, organising together organising to say focus on data engineering
- yeah I felt like the only thing you needed when you were close to the end was Â behavioural and communication/teamwork related things. But when you brought up the bar you covered it - showing in answer
- Back up above, never thought i wouldve linked it but did and really good overall


- When speaking on past experiences, may not have done these things before, most recent experience in terms of, for the role, would be the program.
- Speaking on past experiences would speak from this role or any other role
- Use soft/transferrable skills to show developed something in role and achieved for the employer
- Noticed in terms of answer - did so many amazing things, didn't see enthusiasm - animation in what I can do, how I get here from a technical perspective, thats the way that passion comes through

- Personally could've mentioned R again - harvardx data science oopsies.



## STAR Method for Competency and Scenario Questions


**S**ituation: What when, working for who doing what
**T**ask: What do you need to do/what needed to be done
**A**ction: How did you do the task? What steps did you take?
**R**esult: As a result, what will/has happened at the end
