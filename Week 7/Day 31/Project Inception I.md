### The Requirements:
**Super Cafe Product Client Requirements**

Based on the sales data from each branch that is provided in RAW CSV files, for each row in each CSV file you must.

Remove the Customer Name and the CARD Number - you should not store those anywhere.

Keep a Cash/Card payment method

Reorganise the transaction data so you split out the individual product from each order.

e.g. "Regular Flavoured iced latte - Hazelnut - 2.75, Large Latte - 2.45" into separate data rows for reporting on, normalise this.

This is because they want reports/graphs/visualisations later, on things like:

How many coffees did we sell, of which type, each week?

Which store had the highest sales each week, or day?

What was the total value of Hazelnut Coffee sales each week, totalled for all stores?

What was the total value of Large Latte sales each day, totalled for all stores?

They also wish you to build visualisation of you Cloud Architecture performance and operations
