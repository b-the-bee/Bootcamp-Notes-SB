They will:
- Continue to be your technical instructors and will still monitor and support your individual progress
- Act as product owners or your seniors in the company, focusing on the progress of the total group
- Act as technical leads or seniors.. sometimes


## Well-being

### Use teams channel to communicate
This is because:
- We need to assess
- Check that your communication is healthy and inclusive

Duty of care etc..

### Prioritise well-being above all else

Understand that your team members will have different individual commitments and personal circumstance.
We encourage you to share these with each other as you would in a healthy workplace.
However, there will be personal information that you do not know.
Please be compassionate.

Some people will need flexible working and this will be agreed with staff team and communicated to you.
