# Bootcamp-Notes-SB

This is a **readme** for my notes, you will probably **read** more than just **me**.

These notes were created in and for the note taking software [Obsidian][https://obsidian.md/] (where this readme is formatted appropriately), if you wish to read them easier I highly recommend using it.

The overview of the whole course can be seen here [[Course Master Doc]].

This will be committed at the end of every day (that I can remember).

These notes contain content that I have screen grabbed from different lessons, hence, I do not claim ownership to them. 

These notes may not be fully complete or contain all content and some content may be incorrect, don't rely on this as a primary source of info ^^.
